# Calculator-dapp
Deployed calculator smart contract in solidity through remix IDE and integrated it on frontend
The smart contract here is deployed in rinkeby test-network.
As solidity don't accept floating point number i.e. decimal number so the calculation won't be done for floating point numbers.
For the division the first number should be greater than first number, and greater  than 0/.
